bra-ket-wolf, an implementation of Quantum Werewolf by Vincent Verhoeven <verhoevenv@gmail.com>

Quantum Werewolf is a variant on the well-known party game Werewolf (AKA Mafia). This variant was designed by Steven Irrgang. The main idea is that players don't have one role given tot them but have all roles at the same time in a kind of quantum superposition. Full rules are available on http://puzzle.cisra.com.au/2008/quantumwerewolf.html

This implementation is probably not the fastest possible. Because all possible game states are generated (a combinatorial explosion), it is at the moment probably impossible to play beyond 10 or 11 players.

Future versions might improve speed (Monte-Carlo simulations, some improvements in game state generation) and add more roles.

This program requires Python 2.6 or higher.
